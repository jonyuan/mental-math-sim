# mental-math-sim
python program to practice math problems and save performance data

The goal of the repo is to practice mental math speed and accuracy. A log is included to help me track my improvement over time.
The problems are randomly generated (with Normal distribution) and involve floats with maximum 2 decimal points. Upon test completion, incorrect responses and the correct answers will be displayed. Tests are currently set to 40 problems in 4 minutes (for logging consistency), although this can be changed.

Operations allowed: + - * /

Points are calculated as follows: +1 for each correct, -1 for each unanswered, -1 for each incorrect

Maximum Points: 40
